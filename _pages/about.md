I'm a PhD student. My supervisor is Dr. Zsolt LÃ¡ngi. I spend two years at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. From September, I will continue my study at University of Szeged.

My research interest include discrete, convex and combinatorical geometry. In particular the geometry of normed spaces, geometric isoperimetric problems, equilbrium points of convex bodies, etc.
